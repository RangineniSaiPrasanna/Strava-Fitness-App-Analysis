#  Strava Fitness App â€“ Data Analysis Project

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of user fitness data from the Strava Fitness App, utilizing SQL, Tableau, and Python (Pandas) to derive actionable health and behavioral insights. The goal is to explore trends in physical activity, sleep, heart rate, and calorie expenditure to support data-driven decision-making for fitness monitoring.


## Project Objectives

- Perform structured data analysis using SQL for querying and reporting.
- Develop interactive dashboards in Tableau to visualize user health metrics.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python to uncover patterns and correlations. 
- Derive insights that can aid in personal fitness improvement and application feature enhancements.



##  Tools & Technologies

##  Key Insights

- Identified top users by total steps, calories burned, and active minutes.
- Found positive correlation between sleep duration and active lifestyle patterns.
- Tracked monthly trends in fitness behavior and overall progress.
- Segmented users based on heart rate zones and analyzed effort distribution.
